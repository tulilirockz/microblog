I've always heard of this damn proverb, expression, something, but I've never properly understood it, like, what do you mean by seeing things from  ither perspective? 

Well, today I got it! It's quite literal, but what happened to me was that I was trying to update my custom ublue image and I couldn't properly pull everything from upstream, so I just decided to reset everything and start from scratch. 
 
Everything went fine until I had to decide which name to give it. I thought about naming it something about flowers, then I eventually got to the idea of naming it after a mineral/color like what Silverblue, Lazurite, Kinoite, Vauxite (...) and I picked "Tourquoise", mostly because it is associated with peace, stability and love. 

Annnd apparently tourquoise is also a color! I've never really thought about it so it wasn't a huge thing at first, but when I was watching some videos on YouTube, I've noticed some objects that were tourquoise! and I got so happy for having associated it to the color I was looking at! I guess i was literally seeing the world with other lens eh! 

So, in conclusion, what I wanted yo say was that its interesting that you somehow don't notice stuff that you've been seing constantly for a long time if you aren't specifically

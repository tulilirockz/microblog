I just wanted to make this post because im particularly sad? Im currently about 19 y.o. and im starting to get job opportunities, freelance things, i now have college to worry about, and whatever else, really.

I also currently have 59 unique projects written down that I want to make, things like contributing to linux distros, making a linux distro, contributing to many projects, making a LISP programming language, making stuff with nix, a lot of stuff.

The point really is that I truly wanted to do all these things, and I feel that, if I manage to do these things, I might change tiny parts of the world in a significant way, like the way that some people linux, or use whatever. Honestly, changing anything would me more than enough for me.
I dont exactly know if Ill even get to do all these things, I really wish that I had endless time in this world to execute everything that I want or ever planned to do, it is very sad thinking that maybe at some point ill not be here anymore to do what im set out to do. I still want to learn so much stuff :(

I know its dumb to ramble about such things at such a young age, but still, whenever I grow up, ill have even more interesting ideas and things to do, but ill maybe not be able to do them, I wont have time, or any other reason.

Im very very sad for this possible future outcome and I want and need to make as much stuff as I can so that future me might feel happier about their past! I want to be a good person.

Having someone like my GF in my life really changes all these aspects for me, she gets me to not worry as much about my future and what ill be able to acomplish, since just being with her is straight up amazing, and I dont even need about these things, I hope I eventually figure out a way out of this predicament.

That's all!

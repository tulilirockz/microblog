To be honest, I've always heard people talking about how the "old web" was so much better than our new, corporate, strict web that we have nowadays, 
but I've never really sought after any old websites to actually experience and see what they were talking about. Well, that changed today!

Upon making this hugo blog I've thought about searching some websites tagged ["old web"](https://neocities.org/browse?tag=oldweb) on Neocities
and, from the small portion of them that I've seen, they're pretty much a work of art!

Like, people just use these websites to talk about themselves, or something they find of interest, or just a specific thing, or anything really!
And having all that decentralized and preserved is such an amazing thing! It really humanizes what it means to have a website or a little domain for yourself.

They are all so creative, and different from any website out there, I'm trully happy that these still exist and are being created until nowadays!
I'm surely quite happy to be a smallll tiny little part of all this huge history ðŸŒ¼

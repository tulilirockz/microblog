It has been a while since I've tried out a different operating system other 
than Windows or some generic Linux distribution, and some time ago, I finally
tried Haiku out! (On a VM, but still).

With the current trend of having more and more complex and bloated software,
I'ts quite refreshing to see such an absurdly lightweight and fast system!!

Like, there really is no comparison between something like Windows and this
thing. It really feels like a modern Windows 98-like experience, especially
considering that super fast install time, and fast graphics.

There also are a bunch of modern apps in this system, while still supporting
old stuff like those BeOS applications in the x86 version! I managed to install
a simple Web Browser and log into Discord through it, surprisingly enough!

My friend for some reason had a system with 512 megabytes of RAM and couldn't
find a proper Linux distro that supported that low RAM, so maybe this could be a
nice replacement!

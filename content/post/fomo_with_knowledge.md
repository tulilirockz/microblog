I was listening to this amazing song by the Portal 2 writers called "Cara Mia Addio" and I got just so sad today

Like, its so amazing that they managed to make a song like that, with all the context and everything, I really wanted to know how to do these things! I want to learn itallian to actually know what they're saying, I want to sing something like that at a good level! I want to even, idk, make a song like that!

I've always felt this burning feeling, this kind of fear in a way, of missing out on knowing things, considering there's just so much time for me on this amazing place we call Earth, I really with that I end up knowing as much as I can, I love LOVE doing new things, learning new things, whatever else! I wish I were immortal or something to actually get to learning everything at a great level...

Well, I'm still 18 tho!!! I'll make the most out of my life and try to learn as much as I can, and DO as much as I can!

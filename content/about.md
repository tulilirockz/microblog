So! This is just a small little place for me to talk about some technologies or things that I may have interest in at a certain time.

Like, I'm thinking about making a post about a Libvirtd container that I made inspired by Project Atomic's implementation and how I made it! Or talking about Ublue and how amazing of a project it isss~~~

There are some other things that could be interesting to talk about, like some kinds of flowers, cool places, cool programs, and whatever else! That's pretty much it I guess (⌒▽⌒)☆
